       <h2>Chess</h2>
       <p>just play the best you can, if you dare.</p>
       <a href="#top">Back to top!</a>

       <h2>Checkers</h2>
       <p>Definately a lesser hard game to play...<br />no offense</p>
       <p>Although there is some strategy, I do <br /> think that it really isn't all that.</p>

       <h2>Mencala</h2>
       <p>Just a weird game overall. <br/> Supposedly a game created by the indians.
        <br/> don't know if that's true or not.

        <h2>Boredom</h2>
        <p>Heighly recommend against it.
            <br/> Do absolutely anything but be bored.</p>
